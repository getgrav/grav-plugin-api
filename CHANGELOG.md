# v1.0.0-beta.5
## 04/16/2026

1. [](#bugfix)
    * `/auth/token` now delegates password check to `User::authenticate()` so the core trait's plaintext-password fallback fires — restores long-standing Grav behavior (admin-classic, Login plugin, frontend login) where a `password:` declared directly in `user/accounts/*.yaml` auto-hashes on first successful login. Previous direct `Authentication::verify()` call required users to pre-populate `hashed_password`, which broke the "edit yaml and log in" workflow that operators rely on when the CLI is unavailable

# v1.0.0-beta.4
## 04/15/2026

1. [](#new)
    * Page-view popularity tracker — single-file flat-JSON store with `flock()`, replaces admin-classic's four-file scheme; subscribes `onPageInitialized` for frontend hits only
    * One-shot import + rename of legacy `daily/monthly/totals/visitors.json` into the new `popularity.json` (ISO-keyed, `pages` capped at 500)
    * `popularity.{enabled, history.daily/monthly/visitors, ignore}` config block in `api.yaml`
    * `raw_route` field on serialized pages so admin clients can navigate home / aliased pages correctly
2. [](#improved)
    * Strict super-user scoping: `isSuperAdmin()` honors only `access.api.super` (no fallback to `admin.super`); operators can grant API authority without admin-classic implications
    * `SetupController` writes a minimal admin-next-native account (`site.login` + `api.super` only), with race guards and explicit avatar/2FA reset to prevent flex-stored ghost data
    * `issueTokenPair()` lifted to `AbstractApiController` so setup, login, refresh, and 2FA share one token-shape source
    * Pages list / dashboard stats no longer skip the home page — the virtual pages-root is now distinguished by `$page->exists()` instead of by `route() === '/'`
    * Dashboard `popularity` endpoint reads from `PopularityStore` (handles legacy import transparently)
3. [](#bugfix)
    * Pages list and dashboard `pages.total` undercounted by 1 (the home page was being filtered out)

# v1.0.0-beta.3

1. [new]

    * Add `ai.super` permissions
    * Add missing vendor library

# v1.0.0-beta.2
## 04/15/2026

1. [new]
